.Reproduce This
```javascript
$ bench-runner -g "nextTick|setImmediate"
```

[.address]
How fast would our code run if it deferred one or more times with `process.nextTick()` or `setImmediate()` (see https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/[event loop] for background)?

=== The Test
We stack up one or more calls and time it. Simple.

[source, javascript]
----
const fapply = ( f, n, arg ) =>
      f( n > 1
          ? () => fapply( f, n - 1, arg )
          : () => arg() );

.About the Graphs
- Higher performance means faster allocation.
- Both axes are `log10`
====

==== process.nextTick
```javascript
suite( 'nextTick', () => {
  for ( let i = 1; i <= maxCount; i++ ) {
    bench( i, ( cb ) =>
      fnapply( process.nextTick, i, cb ) );
  }
} );
```

===== setImmediate
```javascript
suite( 'setImmediate', () => {
  for ( let i = 1; i <= maxCount; i++ ) {
    bench( i, ( cb ) =>
      fnapply( setImmediate, i, cb ) );
  }
} );
```

==== Thoughts
* `process.nextTick` runs faster and it should. But we're aren't comparing.
* Deferring is part of life in Node's cooperative world. However, if you have a deep defer stack in the middle of your job, expect a bit of a slowdown, a.k.a. increased latency.

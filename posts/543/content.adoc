How fast can we push the same `String` object to a `null writer`? What is the impact of varying string length, high water mark, and object mode?

[TIP]
====
.Reproduce This
```javascript
$ bench-runner -g "iter.*string"
```
====

=== The Test
In this test, we push `string` objects from a `memory reader` to a `null writer`, using the following settings:

* `encoding`: Chunks are encoded as `string` objects.
* `highWaterMark`:
  ** `default`: Use the default `highWaterMark` (16KiB).
  ** `low`: Force the `highWaterMark` to be always lower than the string length.
  ** `high`: Force the `highWaterMark` to be always higher than the string length.
* `string length`: From 2KiB to 512KiB in steps of powers of 2.

.About the Graphs
- Performance: Higher is better.
- Both axes are `log10`

==== Observations
* Pushing `string` objects incurs computational overhead due to conversion to `Buffer` objects internally. Therefore unlike the previous case, chunk size matters and performance is not constant vs string size.
* Chunk Size vs `highWaterMark`
 ** Performance is slightly better when `chunk size < highWaterMark` (`high` plot) for lower chunk sizes.
 ** Likewise, performance is slightly lower when `chunk size > highWaterMark`, for lower chunk sizes.
 ** In the case of the default `highWaterMark`, the trace follows `high` up to 16KiB after which it follows the `low` plot.

* Operating the stream in object mode restores performance back to those seen with pushing `Buffer` objects since strings are no longer encoded/decoded.

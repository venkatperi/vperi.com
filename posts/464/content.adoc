How fast can Node.js allocate a `2KiB` `Buffer`? What about a `128MiB` `Buffer`?

=== The Test
We allocate Node.js `Buffer` objects of increasing sizes from `2KiB` to `128KiB`, doubling at each step. `Buffers` are allocated via `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`.

[NOTE]
====
.About the Graph
- Higher performance means faster allocation.
- Both axes are `log10`.

==== Observations
* Node allocates smaller `Buffers` faster, clearly. Under the hood, Node calls http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html[malloc(3)]. While numerous wars have been waged on the performance of `malloc()` vs alternatives, the fact remains that operating systems allocate more time to allocate larger buffers.  

==== Thoughts
* If you need large `Buffer` objects on a regular basis, you'll may hit a significant performance bottleneck if you allocate on demand and GC them when you're done. Instead, consider using a buffer pool.

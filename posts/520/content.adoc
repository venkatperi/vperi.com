What's the impact of adding one or more  `TransformStream` objects
in a Node.js stream?

:filter: "passthrough.*false.*default.*buffer"
include::{commondir}/reproduce.adoc[]

=== The Test
Here we look at the impact on our baseline http://vperi.com/2017/07/03/streaming-buffers[memory to null] stream.

The test settings are:

* `encoding`: Chunks are encoded as `Buffer` objects. As we noted http://www.vperi.com/archives/499[earlier], doing so won't incur any conversion overhead and in the absence other computational effort in the stream, performance should not change when `chunk size` is varied.
* `chunk size`: Ranges from `2KiB` to `512KiB`, doubling at each step.
* `highWaterMark`:
  ** `default`: Use the default `highWaterMark` (16KiB)
  ** `low`: Force the `highWaterMark` to be always lower than the chunk size
  ** `high`: Force the `highWaterMark` to be always higher than the chunk size


[NOTE]
====
.About the Graphs
- `count`: The number of `PassThrough` transform streams.
- Performance: higher is better.
- Both axes are `log10`

TIP: See http://vperi.com/2017/07/03/streaming-buffers/#high-water-dip[this] for a discussion on why the traces dip around 16KiB.

==== High Water Mark > Chunk Size

==== Thoughts
- Across the board, performance drops when more `Transform` streams are added. This isn't surprising since both `ReadableStream` and `WritableStream` use `process.nextTick` for synchronous callbacks (see http://vperi.com/2017/07/03/nexttick-setimmediate/[Performance of nextTick]).
- Bottomline: Keep your pipeline depth small.
